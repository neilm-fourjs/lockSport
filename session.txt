Idea is a lock picking sessions
a list of locks
	each one with a preset list of picks a select of tensioners ( 2 )

Then when you start a session, you select the pick click start
then pick that lock, when you finish with the lock you click 'picked' or 'failed' and it moves to the next lock
another option will be to end the session.
session ends when 'end session' is click or all locks in the session have been picked/failed

Requires:
toolbar with start / end / create options
form to show the session as a table of lock / picks / buttons
[lock    |tensioner|pick   |time |picked|failed]

Also requires a way to define the most common picks used with each lock.


Need a maint screen to setup this data:
Tables:
lock_picks
	lock_code
	tensioner_code
	pick_code


session_template:
	session_code
	session_desc
	lock_code
	tensioner_code
	pick_code

session:
	session_id	
	session_code
	session_date
	session_start	
	session_end

Alter pick_history
add session_id
